# It touches only: the chosen program folder, ~/Desktop/sparkTerminal.desktop,
# ~/.local/share/applications/sparkTerminal.desktop and ~/.local/state/sparkTerminal (install record, backups).
# It never uses sudo, never installs system packages and never changes other programs or launchers.
# Options: --dry-run (show what would happen), --remove (runs uninstallSparkTerminal.sh), --folder DIR (skip the folder picker), --help
